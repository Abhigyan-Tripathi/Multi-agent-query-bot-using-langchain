# Multi-Agent Astronomy Query Bot

This project demonstrates how to build a modular, intelligent, and multi-modal AI chatbot that answers astronomy-related queries using documents, images, and web content. It is powered by **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, **ChromaDB** and a Hugging Face LLM.

## Features

- Extracts information from uploaded PDFs
- Scrapes web content for relevant answers
- Uses OCR to process image-based text
- Leverages a multi-agent architecture to route queries smartly
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Chroma and sentence-transformers
- Clean Streamlit UI for interaction

## Technologies Used

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) (for deploying and endpoint creation)
